Revenue Prediction Application
This project is developed to predict the daily revenue of a café based on specific input parameters. The application takes data from the user and displays the predicted results.

Features
User-friendly interface.
Parameters to consider:
Temperature: The temperature of the day (°C).
Rain: Whether it’s raining (0: No, 1: Yes).
Weekend: Whether it’s a weekend (0: No, 1: Yes).
Promotion: Whether there is an active promotion (0: No, 1: Yes).
Café Category: The category of the café (e.g., A, B, C).

Model Training
The machine learning model is trained to predict revenue using the following independent variables:
Temperature
Rain status
Weekend
Promotion
Café category
The model was trained using the Scikit-learn library, and the best-performing model was saved in .pkl format.

Developer
This project was developed by Zeynep Gülten.
